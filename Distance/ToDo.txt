Bugs:
	-None for now?


Priority:
	-Rate limit download attempts.
		-Github does this for us, no?


Cleanup:
	-Config option strings need to be gone over and made consistent.
	-Make nameplate sig(s) optional.
	

Misc:
	-Translations.


Maybe:
	-Options to "attach" widgets to target and focus target bars (coordinates become offsets in this case).
	-Add icon nodes for the range type and boss aggro prefix?  Text versions look a bit ugly/busy, and partially don't work with heavy text mode.
	-Allow the user to set custom colors for different distance values, like in the aggro widget.
	-Add distances for aggro'd enemies to nameplates?
		-This is relatively difficult.  Rough support was added, but disabled in the plugin constructor because it was buggy.
			-Distances didn't always correlate at the same index of nameplate addon node, and nameplate game object.
			-The added nodes caused crashes when hovering in the addon inspector.
				-Is it possible that indexing the nameplate base nodes from the nameplate addon was not the order that we see in the addon inspector?
			-Not sure how to add in-game occlusion to the new nodes like the extant nameplate nodes have.
	-Have an alternate drawing method that uses ImGui instead of game UI elements in case people want to hide stuff from capture.
		-Supporting stuff like font options is going to suck; maybe just add it with absolutely minimal support.
	-Provide IPC for others to get aggro data?
		-Also maybe to get the aggro point on line from an enemy.
	-Option to lock aggro widget to the screen-space projection of the aggro point?
	-Config option to ignore soft target for aggro info.
		-And/or maybe option to attach it to focus target.


Rejected:
	-Editor for aggro data?
		-Not worth the effort; just use a spreadsheet.
		-Having to deal with potential re-sorts based on edits would be annoying.
	-Add an ImGui window over the text node and track its position to allow for dragging?
		-Not worth the effort for a very minor convenience that will rarely be used.
	-Maybe add option to use caution/warning aggro colors as a gradient rather than just step color changes.
		-Probably more work than it's worth, and starting to get into real feature bloat.
	-ImGui cursor position seems to lag the game's cursor position, making a mouseover widget get wiggly sometimes.
		-This actually seems to happen with the game's cursor itself and game UI windows.
		-Problem fixed if using software cursor in options, so not our problem really.
