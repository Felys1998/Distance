Bugs:
	-ImGui cursor position seems to lag the game's cursor position, making a mouseover widget get wiggly sometimes.

Priority:
	-Maybe add option to use caution/warning aggro colors as a gradient rather than just step color changes.
	-Rate limit download attempts.
	-Config option to ignore soft target for aggro info.
	-Add text alignment options.

Cleanup:
	-Config option strings need to be gone over and made consistent.

Misc:
	-Translations.

Maybe:
	-Editor for aggro data?
	-Add icon nodes for the range type and boss aggro prefix?  Text versions look a bit ugly/busy, and partially don't work with heavy text mode.
	-Add an ImGui window over the text node and track its position to allow for dragging?
	-Allow the user to set custom colors for different distance values, like in the aggro widget.
	-Add distances for aggro'd enemies to nameplates?
