Bugs:
	-Unknown

Priority:
	-Maybe add option to use caution/warning aggro colors as a gradient rather than just step color changes.
	-Rate limit download attempts.
	-Config option to ignore soft target for aggro info.

Cleanup:
	-Config option strings need to be gone over and made consistent.

Misc:
	-Translations.
	-Add widget for focus target and mouseover target probably.
		-May as well just go all the way and do what's discussed below.

Maybe:
	-Editor for aggro data?
	-Add icon nodes for the range type and boss aggro prefix?  Text versions look a bit ugly/busy, and partially don't work with heavy text mode.
	-Add an ImGui window over the text node and track its position to allow for dragging?
	-Add an additional distance widget that is offset by a certain amount (and offset configurable for either from ring or center).
		-Maybe allow an arbitrary number of these.
		-Let them use any arbitrary target type (target, soft, focus, mouseover) per-widget
		-Allowing the user to set custom colors for different distance values might be an equivalent or parallel option.
		-To do this, best to set up a widget config class that we can just drop into a list, maybe port over main distance widget to use this.  Aggro probably needs to be kept separate due to specialization.
	-Add distances for aggro'd enemies to nameplates?
