Bugs:
	-¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Priority:
	-Add an option to try to use the target bar text color.
		-Is it better to try to find the node by index, or by ID?
	-Improve aggro data loading.
	-Implement downloading of aggro data file from Github.
	-Add config options for aggro distance indicator.
		-These should include varying color as you get closer (including configurable thresholds).

Cleanup:
	-Config option strings need to be gone over and made consistent.
	-Text commands and all strings need to be cleaned up.

Misc:
	-Text command to cycle/change distance mode.
	-Translations.

Maybe:
	-Editor for aggro data?
	-Add icon nodes for the range type and boss aggro prefix?  Text versions look a bit ugly/busy, and partially don't work with heavy text mode.
	-Add an ImGui window over the text node and track its position to allow for dragging?
	-Add an additional distance widget that is offset by a certain amount (and offset configurable for either from ring or center).
		-Allowing the user to set custom colors for different distance values might be an equivalent or parallel option.
	-Add distances for aggro'd enemies to nameplates?
