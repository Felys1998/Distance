# Distance

## Purpose
**WARNING: PRE-ALPHA PLUGIN**

This is a plugin for [XIVLauncher/Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) that shows basic distance information in a movable game UI element.

## Usage
This plugin works automatically, showing the distance to the target.  In the future, it will show distance until aggroing the boss (for supported bosses).
