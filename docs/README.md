## Purpose
**WARNING: PRE-ALPHA PLUGIN**

This is a plugin for [XIVLauncher/Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) that shows basic distance information on the game's target bar.

## Usage
This plugin works automatically, showing the distance on the target bar.  In the future, it will show distance until aggroing the boss.
