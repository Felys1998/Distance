# Distance

## Purpose
**WARNING: BETA PLUGIN**

This is a plugin for [XIVLauncher/Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) that shows basic distance information in a movable game UI element.

## Usage
This plugin works automatically, showing the distance to the target (or the target's hitring).  It can also show distance until aggroing the boss (for supported bosses).

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute boss aggro range data, please create an issue with the instance/zone name (remember to note normal, savage, extreme, etc.!), boss name, and the distance (preferably to two decimal points).  Aggro distances should be measured from the center of the boss, and *not* the hitring.
